<p>December is the twelfth and final month of the year in the Julian and Gregorian calendars. Its length is 31 days.
    December, from the Très Riches Heures du duc de Berry
    December’s name derives from the Latin word decem (meaning ten) because it was originally the tenth month of the year in the calendar of Romulus c. 750 BC, which began in March. 
    The winter days following December were not included as part of any month. Later, the months of January and February were created out of the monthless period and added to the beginning of the calendar, but December retained its name.[1][2]</p>
